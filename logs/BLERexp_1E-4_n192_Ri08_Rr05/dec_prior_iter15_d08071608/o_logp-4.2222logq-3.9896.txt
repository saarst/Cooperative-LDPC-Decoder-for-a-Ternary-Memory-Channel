Starting parallel pool (parpool) using the 'Processes' profile ...
Preserving jobs with IDs: 3726 because they contain crash dump files.
You can use 'delete(myCluster.Jobs)' to remove all jobs created with profile Processes. To create 'myCluster' use 'myCluster = parcluster('Processes')'.
Connected to parallel pool with 40 workers.
Parallel pool created with 40 workers.
[Warning: A worker aborted during execution of the parfor loop. The parfor loop
will now run again on the remaining workers.]
